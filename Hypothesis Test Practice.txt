
# One Sample Z Test example

We'll examine whether the mean blood pressure of a sample of patients matches a known population mean. We want to determine if the sample's blood pressure differs significantly from the population mean.


## Sample Data
Suppose we have a sample of 20 patients, and we want to test if their average blood pressure is different from a population mean of 120 mm Hg. Here's the sample data:


# Sample data for blood pressure
blood_pressure <- c(130, 125, 135, 128, 122, 132, 127, 129, 128, 131,
                     126, 134, 130, 133, 127, 128, 130, 132, 129, 125)

```

## Step 1: Calculate the Sample Mean and Standard Deviation
First, calculate the sample mean and standard deviation of the blood pressure measurements.


# Calculate sample mean
sample_mean <- mean(blood_pressure)

# Calculate sample standard deviation
sample_sd <- sd(blood_pressure)
```

## Step 2: Define Population Parameters
Next, define the population parameters, including the population mean and the hypothesized value to test against.


# Population mean (known)
population_mean <- 120

# Hypothesized value (the value we want to test against)
hypothesized_value <- 120
```

## Step 3: Calculate the Z-Score
Calculate the Z-score:


# Calculate standard error
standard_error <- sample_sd / sqrt(length(blood_pressure))

# Calculate Z-score
z_score <- (sample_mean - population_mean) / standard_error
```


## Step 4: Perform the Z-Test
Perform the one-sample Z-test using the calculated Z-score.



# Calculate the Z test statistic
z_stat <- (sample_mean - population_mean) / (sample_sd / sqrt(20))
z_stat

```

# Calculate the corresponding p-value
p_value <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z_stat)))

# Display the p-value
p_value
```

## Step 5: Interpret the Results
Let's interpret the results of the one-sample Z-test

The Z-statistic measures how many standard errors the sample mean is away from the population mean.

The p-value tells us whether this difference is statistically significant. A small p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates that the sample mean is significantly different from the population mean.

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
The sample's blood pressure differs significantly from the population mean of 120 mm Hg.

# Two Sample T-Test Example


## Introduction

In this example, we will perform a two-sample t-test to analyze the effectiveness of two different pain relief medications in a pharmacy setting. We want to determine if there is a significant difference in pain relief duration between the two medications: Formula A and Formula B.

## Data

We have collected data from 15 patients for each medication. Here are the pain relief durations (in hours) for each group:


# Data
formula_a <- c(4.2, 3.5, 2.9, 3.8, 4.5, 4.0, 3.7, 3.2, 4.1, 3.0, 3.9, 3.3, 4.4, 3.8, 3.7)
formula_b <- c(3.0, 2.7, 2.2, 2.9, 3.5, 3.1, 2.8, 2.6, 3.4, 2.5, 3.1, 2.8, 3.6, 3.0, 3.2)
```

## Step 1: Descriptive Statistics

Let's begin by calculating some descriptive statistics for each group.


# Descriptive Statistics
mean_a <- mean(formula_a)
mean_b <- mean(formula_b)

sd_a <- sd(formula_a)
sd_b <- sd(formula_b)

# Display Descriptive Statistics
mean_a
mean_b
sd_a
sd_b
```

Interpretation: The mean pain relief duration for Formula A is approximately mean_a hours, with a standard deviation of sd_a. For Formula B, the mean duration is approximately mean_b hours, with a standard deviation of sd_b.

## Step 2: Visualize the Data

We can create a boxplot to visualize the distribution of pain relief durations for each medication.


# Data Visualization
library(ggplot2)

data <- data.frame(
  Formula = c(rep("A", length(formula_a)), rep("B", length(formula_b))),
  PainRelief = c(formula_a, formula_b)
)

ggplot(data, aes(x = Formula, y = PainRelief, fill = Formula)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Pain Relief Duration by Formulation",
    x = "Formulation",
    y = "Pain Relief Duration (hours)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Interpretation: The boxplot shows the distribution of pain relief durations for each medication. Formula A appears to have a slightly higher median duration compared to Formula B.

## Step 3: Perform the T-Test

Now, let's perform a two-sample t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in pain relief duration between the two medications.


# Perform the t-test
t_test_result <- t.test(formula_a, formula_b, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)

# Display the t-test results
t_test_result
```


Interpretation: The t-test results provide a test statistic (t-value) and a p-value. The p-value is t_test_result$p.value. If the p-value is less than our chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), we can conclude whether there is a statistically significant difference in pain relief duration between the two medications.

## Conclusion

Based on the t-test results, we can make a conclusion about the effectiveness of the two pain relief medications. 








# Two Sample T- test example

In this example, we'll compare the effectiveness of two different medications in reducing blood pressure. We'll have two groups: Group A, which takes Medication A, and Group B, which takes Medication B. We want to determine if there is a significant difference in blood pressure reduction between the two groups.


# Sample data for Group A (Medication A)
group_a <- c(130, 135, 138, 142, 128, 133, 137, 131, 136, 139)

# Sample data for Group B (Medication B)
group_b <- c(128, 129, 134, 125, 133, 131, 127, 132, 136, 130)

```
## Step 1: Calculate Descriptive Statistics
First, we need to calculate the means and standard deviations for both groups.


# Calculate mean and standard deviation for Group A
mean_a <- mean(group_a)
sd_a <- sd(group_a)

# Calculate mean and standard deviation for Group B
mean_b <- mean(group_b)
sd_b <- sd(group_b)
```


## Step 2: Create a Box Plot

# Create a side-by-side box plot
boxplot(group_a, group_b, 
        names = c("Medication A", "Medication B"),
        main = "Blood Pressure Reduction by Medication",
        ylab = "Blood Pressure Reduction")

# Add a legend
legend("topright", legend = c("Medication A", "Medication B"), fill = c("blue", "red"))
```



## Step 3: Perform the Two-Sample T-Test
Next, we'll perform the two-sample t-test using the t.test function in R.


# Perform the two-sample t-test
t_result <- t.test(group_a, group_b)
```
## Step 4: Interpret the Results
Now, let's interpret the results.



# Print the t-test results
t_result

```
The output will include several values, but the key ones for our interpretation are:

t statistic: The t-statistic represents the difference in means between the two groups.

p-value: The p-value tells us whether the difference in means is statistically significant. A small p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates statistical significance.

## Step 5: Interpretation
In our example:

The t-statistic measures the difference in blood pressure reduction between Group A (Medication A) and Group B (Medication B).

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis we can conclude that there is a significant difference between the two medications.



# Paired T- test example

In this example, we'll investigate whether a new medication has a significant effect in reducing cholesterol levels in a group of patients. We will measure cholesterol levels in the same patients before and after they took the medication. We want to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in cholesterol levels before and after taking the medication.


# Sample data for cholesterol levels before treatment
before_treatment <- c(220, 240, 250, 230, 215, 245, 260, 235, 225, 255)

# Sample data for cholesterol levels after treatment
after_treatment <- c(195, 215, 222, 208, 189, 219, 247, 206, 213, 225)

```

## Step 1: Create a Plot
Now, let's create a paired data plot (a before-and-after plot) to visualize the change in cholesterol levels.

This code creates a scatter plot of cholesterol levels before and after treatment, with a reference line (red line) showing the line of no change. Points above the line indicate an increase in cholesterol levels after treatment, while points below the line indicate a decrease.


# Create a paired data plot
plot(before_treatment, after_treatment, 
     xlab = "Cholesterol Levels Before Treatment (mg/dL)", 
     ylab = "Cholesterol Levels After Treatment (mg/dL)", 
     main = "Cholesterol Levels Before and After Treatment",
     pch = 19, col = "blue")

# Add a diagonal reference line
abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = "red")

```

## Step 2: Calculate the Differences
First, calculate the differences in cholesterol levels for each patient (before - after).


# Calculate the differences
differences <- after_treatment - before_treatment
```

## Step 3: Perform the Paired T-Test
Next, perform the paired t-test using the t.test function. This test will compare the mean of the differences to zero.


# Perform the paired t-test
t_result <- t.test(differences)

```

## Step 4: Interpret the Results
Now, let's interpret the results of the paired t-test.

The t-statistic measures the mean difference in cholesterol levels before and after treatment with the new drug.

Since the p-value is less than 0.05 (a common significance level), we can conclude that there is a significant difference in cholesterol levels after treatment.



# One way ANOVA example

In this example, we'll analyze the effectiveness of three different drug treatments in reducing pain for patients with a specific condition. We want to determine if there is a significant difference in pain reduction among the three drug treatments.



## Sample Data
Here's some sample data for pain reduction scores for patients in three different drug treatment groups (Group A, Group B, and Group C):


# Sample data for pain reduction scores in Group A
group_a <- c(5, 6, 7, 4, 6, 5)

# Sample data for pain reduction scores in Group B
group_b <- c(4, 3, 5, 4, 3, 4)

# Sample data for pain reduction scores in Group C
group_c <- c(7, 8, 9, 6, 8, 7)

```


## Step 1: Combine Data and Create a Data Frame
First, combine the data from all three groups into a single data frame.


# Combine data into a data frame
data <- data.frame(
  Treatment = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 6),
  PainReduction = c(group_a, group_b, group_c)
)
```

## Step 2: Visualize the Data
Before performing the ANOVA, it's a good practice to visualize the data. We can create a box plot to compare the distributions of pain reduction scores for each treatment group.


# Create a box plot
boxplot(PainReduction ~ Treatment, data = data,
        xlab = "Treatment Group", ylab = "Pain Reduction",
        main = "Pain Reduction by Treatment Group")

```
This code creates a box plot that visualizes the distribution of pain reduction scores for each treatment group.

## Step 3: Perform One-Way ANOVA
Now, let's perform a one-way ANOVA to test whether there are significant differences in pain reduction among the treatment groups.


# Perform one-way ANOVA
anova_result <- aov(PainReduction ~ Treatment, data = data)
```

## Step 4: Interpret the Results
Let's interpret the results of the one-way ANOVA.


# Print ANOVA results
summary(anova_result)
```
The output will include several values, but the key ones for our interpretation are:

Pr(>F): The p-value associated with the F-statistic. It tells us whether there is a statistically significant difference in pain reduction among the treatment groups.


## Step 5: Interpretation
In our example:

The F-statistic measures the variation in pain reduction scores between the treatment groups relative to the variation within the groups.

The p-value associated with the F-statistic tells us whether this variation is statistically significant. If the p-value is less than 0.05 (a common significance level), we can conclude that there is a significant difference in pain reduction among the treatment groups.

Let's interpret the results based on the output:
The t-statistic measures the mean difference in cholesterol levels before and after treatment with the new drug.

The p-value indicates whether this mean difference is statistically significant. Since the p-value is less than 0.05 , we can conclude that there is a significant difference in cholesterol levels after treatment.



# One Proportion Test example

In this example, we'll analyze whether a new drug is effective in treating a specific condition by comparing the proportion of patients who experienced improvement. We want to determine if the proportion of patients who improved with the new drug is significantly different from a predefined target proportion.


## Sample Data
Here's some sample data for a clinical trial:

Total number of patients: 100
Number of patients who improved with the new drug: 63
We will compare the proportion of patients who improved (63 out of 100) to a target proportion (e.g., 0.50) to test if the new drug is effective.

## Step 1: Set Up the Hypotheses
Before performing the one-proportion test, let's set up the null and alternative hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H0): The proportion of patients who improved with the new drug is equal to the target proportion (e.g., 0.50).
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The proportion of patients who improved with the new drug is not equal to the target proportion (e.g., not equal to 0.50).

## Step 2: Perform the One-Proportion Test
Now, let's perform the one-proportion test using the prop.test function in R.




# Define the sample size
n <- 100

# Define the number of patients who improved
x <- 63

# Define the target proportion
p_target <- 0.50

# Perform the one-proportion test
prop_test_result <- prop.test(x, n, p_target)

```

## Step 3: Interpret the Results
Let's interpret the results of the one-proportion test.


# Print the one-proportion test results
prop_test_result
```

## Step 4: Interpretation
The null hypothesis (H0) assumes that the proportion of patients who improved with the new drug is equal to the target proportion (0.50).

The alternative hypothesis (Ha) suggests that the proportion of patients who improved with the new drug is not equal to the target proportion (not equal to 0.50).

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
There is a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who improved with the new drug compared to the target proportion.


# Two Proportion Test example

In this example, we'll compare the proportions of patients who experienced side effects after taking two different medications. We want to determine if there is a significant difference in the proportion of patients experiencing side effects between the two medications.

## Sample Data
Here's some sample data for the two medications:

Medication A: 80 out of 200 patients experienced side effects.
Medication B: 60 out of 200 patients experienced side effects.

## Step 1: Define the Data
We start by defining the data:


# Define the data
success_a <- 80   # Number of patients with side effects for Medication A
n_a <- 200         # Total number of patients for Medication A

success_b <- 60   # Number of patients with side effects for Medication B
n_b <- 200         # Total number of patients for Medication B
```
## Step 2: Perform the Two-Proportion Test
Next, we'll perform a two-proportion test using the prop.test function:


# Perform the two-proportion test
prop_test_result <- prop.test(c(success_a, success_b), c(n_a, n_b))
```

## Step 3: Interpret the Results
Now, let's interpret the results of the two-proportion test.



# Print the two-proportion test results
prop_test_result

```

## Step 4: Interpretation

The prop.test function tests whether the proportions of patients experiencing side effects for Medication A and Medication B are significantly different.

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
There is a statistically significant difference in the proportions of patients with side effects between Medication A and Medication B.

# Chi Square Test example

We'll examine whether there's an association between two categorical variables: the type of pain reliever taken (e.g., Drug A, Drug B, or Drug C) and the occurrence of side effects (Yes or No). We want to determine if there's a significant relationship between the choice of pain reliever and the occurrence of side effects.


## Sample Data
Here's some sample data representing the number of patients who experienced side effects (Yes or No) for each type of pain reliever:


# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  PainReliever = c("A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "C"),
  SideEffects = c("Yes", "Yes", "No", "No", "Yes", "No")
)
```

## Step 1: Create a Contingency Table
First, we need to create a contingency table to summarize the data. This table will show the frequency of patients in each combination of pain reliever and side effects.


# Create a contingency table
contingency_table <- table(data$PainReliever, data$SideEffects)
```

## Step 2: Perform Chi-Square Test
Now, let's perform the Chi-Square test of independence to determine if there's a significant association between the choice of pain reliever and the occurrence of side effects.


# Perform Chi-Square test
chi_square_result <- chisq.test(contingency_table)
```

## Step 3: Interpret the Results
Let's interpret the results of the Chi-Square test.


# Print Chi-Square test results
chi_square_result
```

The output will include several values, but the key ones for our interpretation are:

X-squared: The Chi-Square statistic measures the association between the two categorical variables.

p-value: The p-value tells us whether this association is statistically significant. A small p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates statistical significance.

## Step 4: Interpretation
In our example:

The Chi-Square statistic measures the strength and direction of the association between the choice of pain reliever and the occurrence of side effects.

The p-value associated with the Chi-Square statistic tells us whether this association is statistically significant. Since the p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
There is no statistically significant association between the choice of pain reliever and the occurrence of side effects.
